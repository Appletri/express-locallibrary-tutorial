## About
### Express, NodeJS, PUG, MongoDB

The core of this assignment is to create a library of books where the user can create, read, update, and delete data using express and to deploy it on railway. This project is mostly following the mdn tutorial.

## Note about Deployment

Due to recent changes at heroku and limited space on railway, unable to show off project. I will figure out a different way to deploy the project.
For now, if you would like to view the project, you can clone and run 'npm start' at the root of the project and you will be able to view the project
at http://localhost:3000/.
